    "In this notebook, you'll build your first AI assistant and understand the foundational architecture that powers modern AI systems. We'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic LLM Integration**: Direct API calls to OpenAI\n",
    "- **In-Context Learning**: How to provide context to improve AI responses\n",
    "- **RAG Foundation**: Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",

    "### How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "1. **Run cells sequentially** - Each cell builds on the previous one\n",
    "2. **Follow along with the book** - This notebook corresponds to Chapter 1\n",
    "3. **Experiment freely** - Modify the code to see how it affects results\n",

    "\n",
    "### Book Context\n",
    "This notebook is part of the comprehensive \"Data Strategy for LLMs\" book by Rany ElHousieny. The book focuses on the data strategy that makes AI assistants truly intelligent, not just the technical implementation details.\n",

Our focus is on the data strategy that makes AI assistants truly intelligent.Here, we used OpenAI's API as an example, but the same principles apply to any LLM provider.\n",
