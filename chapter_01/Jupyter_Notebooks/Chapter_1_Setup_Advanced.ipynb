    "For this book, I'm using OpenAI's API as our primary LLM provider. While there are other excellent options like Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or even local models with Ollama, OpenAI provides the most reliable, well-documented, and widely-used API in the industry. The reason I choose OpenAI for this book is the predictable service quality, comprehensive model selection, and industry-standard experience that you'll encounter in production environments. However, you can adapt the code to work with any other API of your choice. LLM calls are not the focus of this book, but are necessary. The focus of this book is about the data we are feeding to the LLM.\n",

    "When I first started building Machine Learning (ML) systems over two decades ago, the biggest challenge wasn't the algorithms or the computing power - it was getting the data right. Today, as we stand at the threshold of the LLM revolution, that fundamental truth hasn't changed. If anything, it's become more critical.\n",

    "The excitement around Large Language Models is justified. These systems can write, reason, and create in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. Every week brings news of models that are bigger, faster, or more capable. But in my experience building intelligent systems - including two decades at Microsoft and now leading GenAI innovation at Clearwater Analytics - I've learned that the most spectacular AI failures share a common thread: they focused on the model while neglecting the data strategy.\n",

    "This notebook is about that reality. It's about the hard-won lessons from production deployments, the stuff that determines whether your AI assistant is a durable, value-creating asset or a spectacular failure. We'll ground every concept in practical code that you can run and experiment with."
