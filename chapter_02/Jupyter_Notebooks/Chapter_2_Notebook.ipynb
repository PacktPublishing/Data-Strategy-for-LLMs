While transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVI) effectively reduce TR and improve quality of life (QoL) in earlier stages of the disease, their effect on reducing HF hospitalizations (HFH) and improving survival remains unclear. METHODS: TRIC-I-HF-DZHK24 (NCT04634266) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentre strategy trial. Approximately 360 patients with severe TR and manifest right-sided HF will be enrolled. In contrast to previous trials, subjects with increased risk for HFH will be selected as facilitated by specific inclusion criteria: HFH in the previous year, or presence of cardio-renal syndrome, or evidence for cardio-hepatic syndrome. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to TTVI and optimal medical therapy (OMT) or continuation of OMT alone. All CE-marked transcatheter repair devices including tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) or transcatheter tricuspid annuloplasty can be used for TTVI. The participating 29 study sites are highly experienced and treated a mean of 176 patients in 4.5 years with T-TEER before study activation. The primary outcome will be assessed at 1 year. First, a composite of all-cause mortality, HFH, and QoL improvement will be tested hierarchically. If positive, the combination of hard clinical endpoints including all-cause mortality and HFH will be tested. Patients will be followed for a total of 3 years. The safety outcome comprises complications of TTVI, life-threatening bleeding and death. CONCLUSIONS: The TRIC-I-HF-DZHK24 trial will define the role of TTVI in patients with severe TR and right-sided HF.\",\n",

We examined 189 mother-child dyads of children born with CHD who underwent neonatal cardiac surgery and completed neurodevelopmental assessment between the ages 13 and 29 months. We used latent profile analysis to identify distinct maternal groups based on prenatal maternal mental health screening scores and individual- and neighbourhood-level social determinants of health factors. We examined the association between maternal groups with their child's gestational age, birth weight, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and neurodevelopment. Latent profile analysis identified two distinct groups: high-risk (n = 46) and low-risk (n = 143). Mothers in the high-risk group had higher mental health screening scores, lower age, higher social vulnerability, lower education, and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance and represent a minority group than mothers in the low-risk group. The high-risk group had children with lower gestational age and weight at birth, longer HLOS, and lower cognitive, language, and motor scales than children in the low-risk group (p < 0.05). Sensitivity analysis in mother-infant dyads without foetal extracardiac conditions found that significant relationships persisted in the high-risk group, with lower gestational age and lower language scale scores than the low-risk group (p < 0.05). Children of mothers with adverse prenatal maternal mental health and social determinants of health risks had significantly worse pregnancy and child outcomes. Interventions are critically needed to address maternal mental health and social determinants of health risks beginning in the prenatal period.\",\n",

The experts concluded that an elevated risk of all-cause mortality and acute cardiovascular events persists for up to 2 years following moderate and severe COPD exacerbations, with the risk of death being highest in the first 30 days after the exacerbation. High smoking rate (especially in males), high indoor and outdoor air pollution in Asia, relatively low vaccination rate in Asia (especially in low- and middle-income countries), and relatively low rate of utilisation of inhaler medications impact the cardiopulmonary risk in Asia.\",\n",

Current therapies, such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, while effective, present safety concerns, especially with their prolonged use. The development of novel topical agents targeting specific inflammatory pathways has emerged as a promising approach for AD management, addressing both the efficacy and safety limitations of more established treatments.\\n\\nAmong these new therapies, Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors like crisaborole and roflumilast and Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors like ruxolitinib and delgocitinib show considerable efficacy and favourable safety profiles in reducing AD symptoms and improving skin barrier function. Additionally, innovative agents like tapinarof an Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) modulator and asivatrep, a TRPV1 antagonist, demonstrate potential in improving AD symptoms with research also exploring the therapeutic role of skin microbiome modulation through topical probiotics.\\n\\nThis research synthesizes findings from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses and observational studies to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of these newer topical agents with the aim of providing insights into optimal management strategies for mild-to-moderate AD in adults. Such evidence is crucial to guide clinical decision-making, improve patient outcomes and enhance therapeutic options in AD care.\"\n",

In this multicenter randomized trial, the clinical benefit and safety of definitive RT with reduced versus standard elective dose were compared.\\n          \\n          \\n            METHODS\\n            Newly diagnosed patients with cT2-4N0-2M0 HNC were accrued and treated in five Dutch centers (definitive accelerated RT, 68 Gy in 34 fractions in 5.5 weeks). Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy were not eligible. Dose for ENI was randomly assigned (2:1; dose reduction, 43 Gy, versus control, 50 Gy). The primary outcome was normalcy of diet score at 1 year. The secondary outcome was recurrence in electively irradiated nodes at 2 years in the dose reduction group with the null hypothesis rejected if the upper-bound one-sided 95% CI exceeded 9%.\\n          \\n          \\n            RESULTS\\n            Between 2016 and 2022, 300 patients were randomnly assigned, of whom 295 were evaluable and included in analysis (dose reduction, 196 and control, 99). The mean normalcy of diet score at 1 year was 91.6 (95% CI, 88.5 to 94.7) in the dose reduction group and 92.6 (95% CI, 88.2 to 97.1) in the control group (mean difference, –1.1 [95% CI, –6.5 to 4.4]). The 2-year recurrence rate in electively irradiated nodes in the dose reduction group was 4.9% (upper-bound one-sided 95% CI, 7.5%). In the control group, this was 4.3% (upper bound one-sided 95% CI, 7.7%). Exploratory analyses demonstrated less acute dysphagia grade ≥3 and better xerostomia-related quality of life in the dose reduction group.\\n          \\n          \\n            CONCLUSION\\n            This is the second randomized controlled trial demonstrating that reduced elective dose is safe in definitive RT for HNC.\"\n",
