    "\n",
    "When we say “vectorizing text,” we’re converting words into numbers so a model can compare meaning efficiently. A few key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector = list of numbers**: Your sentence becomes a 1,536‑number vector with `text-embedding-3-small`. Think of this as 1,536 semantic dials.\n",
    "- **Similarity ≈ closeness**: Two sentences about the same idea produce vectors that point in similar directions. We measure this with cosine similarity (scores closer to 1.0 mean more similar).\n",
    "- **Why not keywords?** Keywords miss paraphrases. Vectors capture meaning, so “marketing sync” and “campaign meeting” can be near each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical trade‑offs you’ll make in production:\n",
    "- **Cost vs nuance**: `-3-small` (1536 dims) is cheaper/faster; `-3-large` (3072 dims) captures more nuance but costs more.\n",
    "- **Storage and speed**: Bigger vectors need more storage and are slower to search. Start small; scale up only if retrieval quality needs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to look for in the output you saw:\n",
    "- `Type: list` and `Items: 1`: You embedded 1 sentence, so you got a list with 1 vector.\n",
    "- `Vector length (dimensions): 1536`: The model’s dimensionality. This is correct for `text-embedding-3-small`.\n",
    "- The first few numbers are `float32`s. Individual values don’t mean much alone—the whole vector is meaningful when compared against others.\n"
