While there are other excellent options like Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or even local models with Ollama, OpenAI provides the most reliable, well-documented, and widely-used API in the industry. The reason I choose OpenAI for this book is the predictable service quality, comprehensive model selection, and industry-standard experience that you'll encounter in production environments. However, you can adapt the code to work with any other API of your choice. LLM calls are not the focus of this book, but are necessary. The focus of this book is about the data we are feeding to the LLM.\n",

    "In the following code, we will define a future‑proof OpenAI assistant that initializes an API client, discovers and prioritizes modern models, selects a working model via a quick smoke test, and exposes a single ask_ai() method with robust retry and error classification. The snippet sets two global variables (OpenAI_API_Key, Model) and, if api_key is available, instantiates FutureProofAssistant at global scope so later cells can simply call assistant.ask_ai(...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components and flow:\n",
    "- Globals: `OpenAI_API_Key`, `Model` are declared for easy access across cells.\n",
    "- Class `FutureProofAssistant`:\n",
    "  - __init__(api_key): saves the key, sets defaults, and calls `_initialize()`.\n",
    "  - `_initialize()`: builds the client, discovers models, selects a working one, then updates global `Model`.\n",
    "  - `_setup_client()`: supports both modern SDK (`openai.OpenAI(api_key=...)`) and legacy (`openai.api_key = ...`).\n",
    "  - `_discover_models()`: calls `client.models.list()`, filters to modern families (e.g., `o4`, `gpt‑4.1`, `gpt‑4o`), and prioritizes them.\n",
    "  - `_select_model()`: tries top candidates with `_test_model()` by making a tiny chat completion; picks the first that works.\n",
    "  - `ask_ai(content)`: validates input, performs up to 3 attempts with backoff on rate limits, and routes errors via `_classify_error()` to user‑friendly messages (`_billing_error_message()`, `_auth_error_message()`, `_model_error_message()`).\n",
    "  - `_extract_content(response)`: returns the assistant text from either `choices[0].message.content` (modern) or `choices[0].text` (legacy).\n",
    "- Global initialization: if `api_key` is set (by earlier setup cells), `assistant = FutureProofAssistant(api_key)` runs at the top level, which makes `assistant` available in `globals()` for later cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters and practical notes:\n",
    "- Resilience: The assistant adapts to SDK differences and changing model names by discovering models dynamically and testing them before use.\n",
    "- Simplicity for downstream cells: Placing `assistant` in the global namespace avoids re‑wiring; later code can do `assistant.ask_ai(\"...\")` without reconfiguration.\n",
    "- Error handling: Billing, auth, model, and rate‑limit issues are detected and surfaced with clear guidance, while other errors retry briefly before failing cleanly.\n",
    "- Extensibility: You can tweak `include_patterns` (model families), `priority` (preferred order), or `max_retries` without touching the rest of the notebook.\n",
    "- Initialization dependency: This block assumes an earlier cell loaded a valid `api_key` (for example from `.env`), otherwise the class raises a clear “No API key provided” error and the bottom‑cell guard prints “Cannot initialize assistant without API key”."

    "### Why embeddings matter\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say “vectorizing text,” we’re converting words into numbers so a model can compare meaning efficiently. A few key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector = list of numbers**: Your sentence becomes a 1,536‑number vector with `text-embedding-3-small`. Think of this as 1,536 semantic dials.\n",
    "- **Similarity ≈ closeness**: Two sentences about the same idea produce vectors that point in similar directions. We measure this with cosine similarity (scores closer to 1.0 mean more similar).\n",
    "- **Why not keywords?** Keywords miss paraphrases. Vectors capture meaning, so “marketing sync” and “campaign meeting” can be near each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical trade‑offs you’ll make in production:\n",
    "- **Cost vs nuance**: `-3-small` (1536 dims) is cheaper/faster; `-3-large` (3072 dims) captures more nuance but costs more.\n",
    "- **Storage and speed**: Bigger vectors need more storage and are slower to search. Start small; scale up only if retrieval quality needs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to look for in the output you saw:\n",
    "- `Type: list` and `Items: 1`: You embedded 1 sentence, so you got a list with 1 vector.\n",
    "- `Vector length (dimensions): 1536`: The model’s dimensionality. This is correct for `text-embedding-3-small`.\n",
