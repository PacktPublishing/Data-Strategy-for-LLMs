    "Before we move on, it helps to build an intuition for what “similarity” means in an embedding space. A classic illustration shows that the vector from `king` to `queen` points in a direction very similar to the vector from `man` to `woman`. In other words, relationships show up as directions in the space.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Vectors close together → similar meaning.** When two texts mean similar things, their points land near each other. For example, “Data strategy is essential for reliable AI” and “A strong data strategy makes AI reliable” will embed close together, while “We hiked in the mountains” will be farther away.\n",

    "  **Figure 3.5: When points are near each other in the space, their meanings are similar.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directions capture relationships.** If two pairs share the same underlying relation, the difference between their vectors tends to point in a similar direction. A classic case is `king→queen` paralleling `man→woman`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **We measure similarity with cosine.** Cosine compares directions, not lengths. Two paraphrases like “Apple iPhone is expensive” and “There is a new Apple iPhone” will have a higher cosine than unrelated text like “Mango is a fruit.” Smaller angle ⇒ higher cosine.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we say “vectorizing text,” we’re converting words into numbers so a model can compare meaning efficiently. A few key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector = list of numbers**: Your sentence becomes a 1,536‑number vector with `text-embedding-3-small`. Think of this as 1,536 semantic dials.\n",
    "- **Similarity ≈ closeness**: Two sentences about the same idea produce vectors that point in similar directions. We measure this with cosine similarity (scores closer to 1.0 mean more similar).\n",
    "- **Why not keywords?** Keywords miss paraphrases. Vectors capture meaning, so “marketing sync” and “campaign meeting” can be near each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical trade‑offs you’ll make in production:\n",
    "- **Cost vs nuance**: `-3-small` (1536 dims) is cheaper/faster; `-3-large` (3072 dims) captures more nuance but costs more.\n",
    "- **Storage and speed**: Bigger vectors need more storage and are slower to search. Start small; scale up only if retrieval quality needs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to look for in the output you saw:\n",
    "- `Type: list` and `Items: 1`: You embedded 1 sentence, so you got a list with 1 vector.\n",
    "- `Vector length (dimensions): 1536`: The model’s dimensionality. This is correct for `text-embedding-3-small`.\n",
    "- The first few numbers are `float32`s. Individual values don’t mean much alone—the whole vector is meaningful when compared against others.\n"
